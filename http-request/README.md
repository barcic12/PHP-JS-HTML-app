## HTTP Requests Web Application Documentation

Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of a web application that allows users to make various HTTP requests to a server and display the server's responses. The application is built using HTML, JavaScript (both client-side and server-side), and PHP.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the web application is defined as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declaration of the HTML document type.

<html>: The root HTML element.

<head>: The document head containing metadata, script links, and stylesheets.

<title>: Specifies the title of the webpage.
<script>: Links to JavaScript files, including client.js and main.js.
<link rel="stylesheet">: Links to an external CSS file for styling.
<body>: The main content of the web page.

<div className="container">: A container div for the entire application.
<h1>: Displays the title of the application.
<div id="buttons">: Container for dynamically generated buttons.
<div id="responseContainer">: Container for displaying HTTP responses.
<button onclick="goto('')">Back</button>: A button for navigation (functionality not provided in the code; requires further implementation).

## Client-Side JavaScript

Client-side JavaScript code is responsible for creating buttons, handling user interactions, and making HTTP requests to the server:

MyButton class: Creates buttons with event listeners that perform HTTP requests when clicked.

constructor(): Initializes a button element and attaches a click event listener to trigger the performRequest() method.
performRequest(id): Sends a POST request to the server with the specified id and updates the responseContainer with the server's response.
DOMContentLoaded event listener: Initializes several instances of the MyButton class with different configurations.

## Server-Side PHP

Server-side PHP code processes HTTP requests and provides responses:

header("Content-Type: application/json"): Sets the response content type to JSON.

json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"), true): Parses JSON data from the HTTP request.

switch ($id): Switch statement based on the received id parameter.

Case statements handle different request types and provide corresponding responses, including HTML content, JSON data, and HTTP error codes.

## Usage Instructions

To use the HTTP requests web application:

Open the webpage in a web browser.
Buttons are displayed in the "buttons" container.
Click on a button to initiate an HTTP request.
The server processes the request and sends a response.
The response is displayed in the "responseContainer."
The "Back" button can be used for navigation (functionality not provided in the code).
