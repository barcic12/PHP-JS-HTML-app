## CSS Styling

CSS styles are applied to various elements to enhance the visual presentation of the web application. Key styles include:

Styling for <h1> and <img> elements.
Button styling, including border, background color, width, height, padding, margin, and cursor effects for normal and hover states.

## JavaScript Functions

The JavaScript code defines several functions to enable stopwatch functionality:

startTimer(): Starts the stopwatch timer by setting an interval to call updateTimer() every second.
stopTimer(): Stops the stopwatch timer by clearing the interval set by startTimer().
resetTimer(): Resets the stopwatch timer by stopping it and resetting the minutes and seconds to zero.
updateTimer(): Updates the displayed timer by incrementing seconds and minutes, formatting the time, and updating the DOM element with the new time.

## Usage Instructions

To use the stopwatch web application:

Open the webpage in a web browser.
Click the "play" button (Start) to start the stopwatch timer.
Click the "Stop" button to pause the timer.
Click the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch to zero.
The timer displays minutes and seconds in the format "00:00".
Optionally, use the "Back" button for navigation (functionality not provided in the code; requires further implementation).
